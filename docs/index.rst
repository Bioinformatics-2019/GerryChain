GerryChain
========

GerryChain is a library for using `Markov Chain Monte Carlo`_ methods to study the problem
of political redistricting. It was created by the `Metric Geometry and
Gerrymandering Group`_ (MGGG) in their `Voting Rights Data Institute`_ (VRDI)
program. The project is hosted in the `MGGG/GerryChain`_ GitHub repo.
