GerryChain
==========

GerryChain is a library for using `Markov Chain Monte Carlo`_ methods to study the problem
of political redistricting. Development of the library began during the
`Voting Rights Data Institute`_ (VRDI). The project is in active development in the `MGGG/GerryChain`_ GitHub
repository, where `bug reports and feature requests`_, as well as `contributions`_, are welcome.
